Traveling Salesman

Welcome to the traveling salesman competition.

The routes are located in "routes". Each route consists of a set of 2d points. Each point is represented with 2 signed bytes (-128 to 127).

The results are located in "results". The result file consists the route points rearranged in the order of travel.

To get started, create a directory with your name and start writing some code. Good luck.
